Code for the determination of hand ranks and values in Texas Hold'em. 

## Overview

I suppose I could go all-in on this project, add support for betting, player agents with various strategies, and create a 
testbed/simulator, but... there's gotta be a gazillion of those things already. I was really just interested in understanding 
how to calculate those win probability estimates you see watching WSOP on ESPN and such. I obtained validation for my use of a Monte Carlo 
approach for the timely estimation of pre-flop odds from [[1]](http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~niadr/PUBLICATIONS/LIACC_publications_2011_12/pdf/CN10_Estimating_Probability_Winning_LFT.pdf), 
which was a useful summary.
